# manimStudies

Compilation of my own studies and attempts on creating educational content (and some random beautiful math animations) with manim.

Just installed the package using conda forge to ensure ffmpeg and all other requirements seamless instalation with the command:

`conda install -c conda-forge manim`

and from that on started to do my first attempts to develop something in the branch `origin/first-attempts` using the content and advices.
 
The content is heavily inspired in the tutorial grant provided in the video tutorial for manim beginers [here](https://youtu.be/rbu7Zu5X1zI?si=QvxhYIfK4_APWjJh).
